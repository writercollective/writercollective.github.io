#### Lindsay Funkhouser
Lindsay Funkhouser is Resource Director and Staff Writer at the Austin Stone Community Church. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Marketing from the University of Illinois, and a graduate degree in Sports Management from the University of Texas. So it makes perfect sense that her day job is neither of those things.
The Charlatan is her first fiction podcast, and she is currently writing her first YA novel, a story in which bravery and friendship save the day. She spent her childhood reading Shel Silverstein and Lois Lowery, and was always the first back to her desk after recess to see if her Weekly Reader order had arrived.
Lindsay is a certified MBTI consultant, and when she’s not writing or hiking in the Hill Country, you can usually find her using personality-based tools to help individuals and teams thrive in their purpose. (A very INFJ thing to do.)
She is also online at [dailymed](http://dailymedblog.com) and [developmentculture](http://developmentculture.com).

#### Anna Sargeant
Anna Sargeant found her love of writing as a teacher, when she quickly discovered her favorite part of the day was reading aloud to her kids. Since leaving the teaching profession, Anna has written two books for children, studied under award-winning children’s book author, Liz Garton Scanlon, and was a member of SCBWI. The book Anna always wishes she had written was Bridge to Terabithia. She’s convinced the line, “I am now the fastest runner in the fifth grade” is one of the best ever written.

Anna enjoys writing fiction podcasts because it's a medium that highlights dialogue. Since dialogue between 2-3 people has always been one of her favorite things to do, it makes sense that it's one of her favorite things to write.

For her day job, Anna is the Director of Children's Curriculum and Staff Writer at the Austin Stone. She also writes freelance for nonprofits and composes thoughts on faith and infertility on her blog, anna-sargeant.com. When Anna is not at her computer, you might find her riding her bike, watching a movie, reading her Kindle, or flying on planes.
